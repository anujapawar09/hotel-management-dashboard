# Hotel Booking Analysis & Dashboard | Python + Power BI

Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Before building the dashboard, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using Python to understand booking patterns and clean the dataset.

EDA Activities:

- Checked and handled missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Analyzed cancellation trends
- Studied seasonal booking patterns
- Examined customer types and lead time behavior
- Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- This helped identify key metrics and insights that were later implemented in the Power BI dashboard.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- DAX
- Power Query
- CSV / Excel Dataset

## 📈 Dashboard Explanation
- Displays daily booking trends to understand demand patterns
- Compares weekday vs weekend bookings
- Analyzes booking lead time (how far in advance customers book)
- Segments customers based on loyalty levels
- Evaluates booking performance across different channels

- ## 📊 Key KPIs
- Total Bookings
- Cancellation Percentage
- Total Revenue
- Total Room Nights
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis in Python to building a business-ready Power BI dashboard. 
The insights generated help hotel management understand booking behavior, revenue trends, and cancellation patterns, supporting smarter operational and pricing decisions.
